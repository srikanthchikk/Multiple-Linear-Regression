# Multiple-Linear-Regression
1. Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear regression as it takes more than one predictor variable to predict the response variable. 2. Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable. 3. For MLR, the dependent or target variable(Y) must be the continuous/real, but the predictor or independent variable may be of continuous or categorical form. Each feature variable must model the linear relationship with the dependent variable. MLR tries to fit a regression line through a multidimensional space of data-points.
